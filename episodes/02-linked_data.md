## 2.2 RDF triples

 - The RDF is a conceptual data model, It is based on the idea of making statements about resources in expressions of the form (subject–predicate–object), known as triples.
 - The subject denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object.

* Option 1 set focus or on the usage of it for librarians
* Option 2: merge this completely into Module 1
* Option 3: Put to the end (later module)
