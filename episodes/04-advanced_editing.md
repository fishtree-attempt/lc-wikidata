## 4.1 Disclaimer
The tools are under heavy development and due to that they might change or don't work as expected. If that happens just move on to the next episode.

## 4.2 Adding statements via sourcemd and quickstatements

Go to [pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), scroll down to "latest literature" and select an article: 
![latest_articles](../fig/episode_04_screenshot_01_latest_articles.png)

Save the DOI, PMID or PMCID of the article:

![choose_doi](../fig/episode_04_screenshot_02_choose_doi.png)

Go to [sourcemd](https://sourcemd.toolforge.org/orcidator_old.php) and paste the DOI or PMID into the search field:

![paste_into_sourcemd](../fig/episode_04_screenshot_03_paste_into_sourcemd.png)

Click on "check source". Now you can see automatically generated statements including meta data of the article like author names or date of publication. Click on "Open in QuickStatements".

![open quickstatements](../fig/episode_04_screenshot_04_open_quickstatements.png)

A new window with QuickStatements will pop up. Now you'll get an overview of the new item and its statements. Confirm the changes by hitting the the "run" button:
