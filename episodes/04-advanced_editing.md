## 4.1 Introduction
Why Wikidata uses references:
Like in Wikipedia it is important that content can be verified by others to make sure it is correct and comes from a reliable source of information, such as a book, scientific publication, or newspaper article.
A Reference (or source) is used to point to specific sources that back up a claim in Wikidata. A reference can be a link to a URL or an item; for example, a book. Wikidata does not aim to answer the question of whether a statement is correct, but only whether the statement appears in a reference.

## 4.2 Adding references

- Support a statement by reference
- TODO - find example; Backup solution use the "origin of species example"
