title: "Advanced editing"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How to add reference and follow good practice?"
objectives:
- Use some tools for editing, e.g. TABernacle, Wikidata Games, QuickStatements, Source MetaData or Author Disambiguator/Author resolver
- Understand community norms around WikiData and why they're important
- Be comfortable with collaborative, decentralized data creation e.g. carpentry participants should be able to identify gaps in Wikidata that could be filled not just by the participants themselves (and at the event) but by their community more broadly, or specific actors within it
- Add references appropriately
- Be able to compare process of editing to process of editing/adding metadata in existing library information systems (ILS, IR)...?
- Understanding Identifiers
- Connect to how this improves things for our patrons/users...
